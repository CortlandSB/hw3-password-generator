# hw3-password-generator

For this assignment, I modified the starter script.js code to design an application that generates random passwords based on specified criteria.

I edited the writePassword function. In it, I placed prompts for the user to choose which kinds of characters would be in the generated password. I also added functions to randomly choose a character type and to generate a random password from specified character types.
